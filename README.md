# First website created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
<br />

It grabs test users from JSON placeholder API and renders cards of random robots from Robohash API. <br />

Once the robots are loaded, you can search for specific names using the search box. <br />

The state management was updated to be handled using `Redux`. <br />

**Note: All the styles where made using the library `tachyons`. The goal whas React, not CSS** <br />

## clone `npm start` to see React at its simplest =)
