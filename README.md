# My first website created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
<br />

* It grabs test users from JSON placeholder API and renders cards of random robots from Robohash API.

* Once the robots are loaded, you can search for specific names using the search box. <br />

* The state management is handled using `Redux`. <br />

**Note: All the styles where made using the library `tachyons`. The goal whas React, not CSS** <br />
